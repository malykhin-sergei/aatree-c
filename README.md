# aatree-c
[Self-balancing binary tree (AA-tree)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AA_tree) implemented in pure ANSI C. The implementation is iterative (non-recursive), no memory allocations performed under the hood. It uses an embedded struct `aatree_node_t` that contains 3 pointers (to the parent, left, and right nodes) and a byte value to indicate the level (height of a corresponding node in the 2-3 tree) of the current node. Embedding the `aatree_node_t` struct makes an intrusive container. The same object can be made to belong to an arbitrary number of different containers.
